# 🏫 TwinKampus: The Campus Twin

**An interactive 3D digital twin of a real-world campus — built using AutoCAD, React, and Three.js.**

This self-contained project transforms 2D sketches or building plans into immersive 3D visualizations rendered in a web browser. Perfect for showcasing architecture, learning digital twin workflows, or building a portfolio in web-based 3D visualization.

cd twin-kampus
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run Locally

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Export & Add 3D Models

* Export models from AutoCAD or Fusion 360 as `.glb` or `.obj`
* Place them in the `/public/models` directory
* Load them using `GLTFLoader` or `OBJLoader` in your Three.js scene

## 🌍 Deployment

### Option 1: Vercel

```bash
npm run build
npx vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
npm install --save gh-pages
npm run deploy
```

Add the following to `package.json`:

```json
"homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/twin-kampus",
"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
